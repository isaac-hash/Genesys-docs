# Genesys Framework Components

This document provides an overview of the components of the Genesys framework. Each feature is documented in detail in its own file.

## Core Concepts

- [**Decorators**](./decorators.md): Learn about the decorator-based approach for creating nodes.
- [**Pipelines**](./pipeline.md): Understand how to define and run complex component graphs.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

- [**`genesys new`**](./cli_new.md): Create a new Genesys workspace.
- [**`genesys make`**](./cli_make.md): Scaffold packages, nodes, and components.
- [**`genesys build`**](./cli_build.md): Build your workspace.
- [**`genesys run`**](./cli_run.md): Run a node by its name.
- [**`genesys launch`**](./cli_launch.md): Launch ROS 2 launch files.
- [**`genesys pipeline`**](./cli_pipeline.md): Manage and run pipelines from the CLI.
- [**`genesys sim`**](./cli_sim.md): Create and run Gazebo simulations.
- [**`genesys doctor`**](./cli_doctor.md): Diagnose environment issues.
- [**ROS 2 Wrappers**](./cli_ros.md): Use common `ros2` commands with automatic workspace sourcing.
- [**`genesys rqt`**](./cli_rqt.md): Launch RQT tools.
