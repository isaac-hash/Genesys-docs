This guide walks you through installing **ROS 2** and setting up the **Genesys Robotics Framework** on your system.  
Follow each step carefully to ensure a smooth setup experience.

## Prerequisites

<Step>
<StepItem title="System Requirements">

Genesys is built on top of **ROS 2**, so your system must meet the ROS 2 requirements:

- **Operating System**:  
  - Ubuntu 22.04 (recommended)  
  - Ubuntu 24.04 (supported)  
  - Windows & macOS (partial support through containers)
- **Processor**: 64-bit Intel/AMD  
- **RAM**: Minimum 4GB (8GB recommended)  
- **Disk Space**: At least 5GB free

To check your OS version:

```bash
lsb_release -a
````

<StepItem title="Git">
Git is required to clone the Genesys framework repository.

Install Git:

```bash
sudo apt install git -y
```

Verify:

```bash
git --version
```

<StepItem title="Code Editor">
Recommended editors:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [JetBrains Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/)
* Any editor of your choice

</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Required Knowledge">
Before working with Genesys, you should have a basic understanding of:

* **ROS 2 Core Concepts** (nodes, topics, services, actions)
* **Python or C++** (Genesys supports both)
* **Linux terminal usage**
* **Robotics basics** (optional but helpful)

## Installing ROS 2

<Step>

<StepItem title="Setup Sources & Keys">

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl gnupg lsb-release
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Add repository:

```bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu \
$(. /etc/os-release && echo $VERSION_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
```

</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Install ROS 2 Humble (Ubuntu 22.04)">
Recommended for Genesys:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop-full
```

</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Setup Environment">

Source ROS 2 automatically:

```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Verify installation:

```bash
ros2 --version
```

## Genesys Installation

This guide will walk you through the "happy path" of creating a complete ROS 2 project from scratch. In just a few minutes, you will:

- Create a new, structured workspace.
- Generate a ROS 2 package and a publisher node inside it.
- Build your project with a single command.
- Run your new node.

Let's get started!

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following set up:

- **A ROS 2 Distribution**: Genesys requires an installed ROS 2 distribution (like Humble or Iron).
- **ROS_DISTRO Environment Variable**: Make sure this variable is set. You can check it with `echo $ROS_DISTRO`.

### Step 1: Installation and Setup

Before you can create a project, you need to install the Genesys CLI and ensure your environment is correctly configured.

#### 1. Check ROS 2 Environment

First, make sure you have a ROS 2 distribution (like Humble or Iron) sourced and the ROS_DISTRO environment variable is set. You can check it with:

```bash
echo $ROS_DISTRO
```

If this command doesn't print your ROS 2 version (e.g., `humble`), you'll need to source your ROS 2 setup file (e.g., `source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`).

#### 2. Install the Genesys CLI

Install the framework's command-line interface using pip. The `setup.py` file defines the package name `genesys-framework-cli`.

```bash
pip install genesys-framework-cli
```

#### 3. Update Your PATH

The pip command often installs executables in a local directory that isn't in your system's PATH by default. To make the `genesys` command available everywhere, you need to add this directory to your PATH.

Run this command to add it for your current terminal session:

```bash
export PATH="$(python3 -m site --user-base)/bin:$PATH"
```

For a permanent change, add this line to your shell's startup file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`):

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$(python3 -m site --user-base)/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

#### 4. Verify Your Setup

In a new terminal, run the Genesys doctor to check that everything is configured correctly:

```bash
genesys doctor
```

If all checks pass with a green light, you're ready to build your first project!

### Step 2: Create a New Workspace

Now that the CLI is installed, let's create a new project workspace. This command scaffolds a standard directory structure for you.

```bash
genesys new my_robot_ws
cd my_robot_ws
```

This creates a `my_robot_ws` directory containing `src/`, `launch/`, `config/`, and other standard ROS 2 folders.

### Step 3: Create a Package and a Node

Next, let's generate a Python package and a simple publisher node inside it. The `--with-node` flag tells Genesys to create a default node right after creating the package.

```bash
genesys make pkg demo_pkg --with-node
```

You will be prompted to choose the type of node; the default is a publisher node. For now, go with the publisher node.

The interactive wizard will guide you. When it's done, Genesys will have automatically:

- Created a package directory at `src/demo_pkg`.
- Generated the necessary `package.xml` and `setup.py` files.
- Created a node file at `src/demo_pkg/demo_pkg/demo_pkg_node.py`.
- Registered the node as an executable in `setup.py`.
- Generated a launch file at `launch/demo_pkg_launch.py` to run your new node.

### Step 4: Build the Workspace

With our code generated, it's time to build the project. The `build` command is a powerful wrapper around the standard ROS 2 tools.

```bash
genesys build
```

This single command runs `colcon build` and automatically sources the `install/setup.bash` file, making your new executables available in your current terminal.

### Step 5: Run Your Node

Finally, let's run the node. With Genesys, you don't need to remember which package a node belongs to.

```bash
genesys run demo_pkg_node
```

You should see output in your terminal as the node publishes messages. To see the messages being published, open a new terminal and run:

```bash
genesys topic echo /chatter
```

### Congratulations!

You have successfully installed Genesys, created, built, and run your first ROS 2 application. You've seen how the unified CLI and auto-generation tools can significantly speed up your development workflow.
