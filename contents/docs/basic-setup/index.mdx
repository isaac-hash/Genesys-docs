## Genesys Framework

The **Genesys Robotics Framework** is a developer-friendly, opinionated framework built to simplify how you architect, build, and deploy modern **ROS 2** robotics applications.

Inspired by the elegance of Laravel and the modularity of enterprise-grade tooling, Genesys provides a predictable project structure, a powerful CLI, plug-and-play robot modules, and first-class simulation + deployment workflows.

Whether you're building autonomous mobile robots, manipulators, custom research projects, or production-ready systems, Genesys gives you a clean, scalable foundation that eliminates boilerplate and accelerates robotics development.

## Why Use Genesys?

Genesys was built to remove the complexity surrounding ROS 2 project structure, multi-language workflows, simulation tools, and deployment pipelines.  
It works for beginners, researchers, and teams building production-grade robotics systems.

With a batteries-included structure, opinionated defaults, and a Laravel-style developer experience, Genesys ensures your robotics workflow stays fast, modular, and scalable.

Use it for:

- **Autonomous Systems** – mobile robots, drones, AMRs
- **Manipulators & Arms** – pick-and-place, industrial arms
- **Research Projects** – AI perception, SLAM, navigation
- **Simulation Pipelines** – Gazebo, RViz, and hybrid testing
- **Production Robotics** – structured deployment and reproducible environments

You retain full control—customize everything from configs to robot modules with zero lock-in.

## Using This Framework

Use the navigation menu on the left to explore the framework.  
Documentation flows from installation → project structure → modules → simulation → deployment, but you can jump to any section.

Use the right-side table of contents to move through each page faster.
