# Welcome to the Genesys Framework Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **Genesys**, an opinionated, developer-friendly framework for **ROS 2**.  
Genesys is built to reduce boilerplate, streamline common workflows, and give you a clear “happy path” for robotics development.

It wraps the powerful — but often verbose — ROS 2 toolchain into a unified, intuitive CLI so you can focus on *robot logic*, not endless setup.

The goal of Genesys is **not** to replace ROS 2, but to enhance it. It provides a powerful foundation so you can focus on creating innovative features and delivering value.

:::note
**Key Principle:** Every Genesys project remains a **100% valid ROS 2 project**.  
You can always fall back to native tools like `colcon build` and `ros2 run` at any time.

## Why Genesys?

Genesys was created to solve common pain points for both new and experienced ROS 2 developers:

### 🔧 Simplified Build System  
Automates package creation, dependency management, and the entire `colcon build` process into a single:

```bash
genesys build
```
## ✨ Zero Boilerplate

Genesys simplifies robotics development by eliminating repetitive ROS 2 boilerplate.

It uses Python decorators such as:

- `@node`
- `@publisher`
- `@subscriber`
- `@timer`

…and C++ macros to drastically simplify node and topic creation.

## ⚙️ Automated Configuration

Genesys automatically generates and registers:

- Launch files  
- Configuration files  
- Executables  

No more manually editing:

- `setup.py`
- `CMakeLists.txt`

Just to add or modify a node.

## 🧰 Unified Tooling

Genesys provides a single, cohesive CLI:

```bash
genesys
```

- Creating new packages
- Building workspaces
- Running nodes
- Launching simulations
- Managing config files
- Organizing your entire robotics workflow
