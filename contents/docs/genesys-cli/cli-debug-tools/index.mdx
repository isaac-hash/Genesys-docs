# CLI: ROS 2 Wrappers

Genesys provides a set of convenient wrappers around the most common `ros2` CLI command groups. These wrappers automatically source your local workspace's `install/setup.bash` file before executing the command, so you don't have to remember to do it yourself.

## Why Use Them?

The main advantage is convenience. In a typical workflow, you might open a new terminal and forget to source your workspace overlay. If you then try to interact with a node or topic from your workspace using `ros2 topic echo`, it will likely fail.

By using the `genesys` wrappers (`genesys topic echo`), the command ensures the environment is correctly set up first, leading to fewer "package not found" or "topic not found" errors.

## Usage

You can use these commands exactly like their `ros2` counterparts, but with `genesys` as the prefix.

```bash
# Instead of 'ros2 topic list'
genesys topic list

# Instead of 'ros2 param get /my_node my_param'
genesys param get /my_node my_param
```

## Notes on Specific Commands

Some commands have slightly different behavior or are not implemented.

- **`genesys service info`**: The `ros2 service info` command does not exist. This wrapper is a convenience alias for `genesys service type`.
- **`genesys action type`**: The `ros2 action type` command does not exist. This wrapper is a convenience alias for `genesys action info`.
- **`genesys service echo`**: This feature is not implemented, as it would require a custom node to intercept and print service requests.
- **`genesys action echo`**: This feature is not implemented, as it would require a custom node to monitor the action feedback and result topics.
